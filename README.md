## About
The ToDo list application offers users the ability to perform task management operations, including adding, deleting, and modifying tasks.

In addition, a user-friendly interface has been crafted using CSS to enhance the overall user experience.

- Adding a task by simply entering the task description and clicking the 'Add' button.
- Deleting tasks can be accomplished by clicking the 'Delete' button next to an individual task or selecting multiple tasks and using the 'Delete All' option.
- Modifying a task is achieved by double-clicking on the task name, which transforms it into an editable field. The task updates once you fill in the necessary changes and confirm.

The application is backed by an H2 database, ensuring efficient data management
